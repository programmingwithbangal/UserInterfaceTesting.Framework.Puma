# UserInterfaceTesting.Framework.Puma <img src ="UserInterfaceTesting.Framework.Puma/images/puma.jpg" width=119>
This is a User Interface testing Framework using Java, Gradle, TestNG and Selenium WebDriver to test UltimateQA Practice site.

## Selenium WebDriver <img src ="UserInterfaceTesting.Framework.Puma/images/selenium.png" width=79>
Selenium WebDriver is a collection of open source APIs which are used to automate the testing of a web application. Selenium WebDriver tool is used to automate web application testing to verify that it works as expected. It supports many browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Safari. WebDriver is a web automation framework that allows you to execute your tests against different browsers. It also enables you to use a programming language in creating your test scripts. https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/

## Project Natures

### Gradle <img src ="UserInterfaceTesting.Framework.Puma/images/gradle.png" width=159>
Gradle is an open-source build automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration.[2] Gradle uses a directed acyclic graph ("DAG") to determine the order in which tasks can be run.

### TestNG <img src ="UserInterfaceTesting.Framework.Puma/images/testng.png" width=119>
TestNG is a testing framework for the Java programming language inspired by JUnit and NUnit. The design goal of TestNG is to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc., with more powerful and easy-to-use functionalities.
